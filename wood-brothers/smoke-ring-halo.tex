\begin{verse}
    Bet your heart was an ice cube last ^{C}night ^{C} ^{F} ^{C} ^{G} \\
    Just chillin' your whiskey ^{C}blood ^{C} ^{F} ^{C} ^{G} \\
    Puttin’ your ^{E}mind way out of ^{Am}sight and ^{Am/G}that's okay \\
    ‘Cause ^{F}you got a smoke ring ^{C}halo that ^{G}just won’t blow ^{C}away
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
    I heard today you have to ^go ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    And I guess we all get carried ^away ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    You’re just a ^saint with a cigar^ette jones and ^that's okay \\
    ‘Cause ^you got a smoke ring ^halo that ^just won’t blow ^away 
\end{verse}

\begin{interlude}
    ^{C7} You deserve better ^{Cdim7} and that’s all I know \\
    ^{C} And I just hope they ^{G}get it right ^{F}in that place that's you're goin' ^{C} \\
    ^{C7} You used to be covered ^{Cdim7} in a circle of gold \\
    Won’t you ^{C}let some angel ^{G}blow away your ^{F}smoke ring ^{C}halo
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
    We’re all gonna miss you blowin' your ^horn ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    And showin' us your busted ^heart ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    You blow so ^hard your lips are ^torn and ^that's the way \\
    ‘Cause ^you got a smoke ring ^halo that ^just won't blow ^away
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
    We all got things that we can't ^help ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    You always had to take a bullet for a ^stranger ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} ^ {} \\
    I heard ^today you took one for ^yourself and ^that's okay \\
    ‘Cause \chord{F}you got a smoke ring \chord{C}halo \chord{G} \chord{C} \\
    \chord{F}You got a smoke ring \chord{C}halo \chord{G} \chord{C} \\
