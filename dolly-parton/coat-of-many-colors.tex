\begin{intro}
^{G}Back through the years I go wonderin' once again \\
Back to the seasons of my ^{C}youth \\
I re^{G}call a box of rags that someone gave us \\
And how my momma put the rags to ^{C}use \\
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
There were ^{G}rags of many colors,
every piece was small \\
And I didn't have a coat
and it was ^{D}way down in the fall \\
Momma ^{G}sewed the rags together
sewin' ^{C}every piece with love \\
She made my ^{G}coat of many colors 
that ^{D}I was so ^{G}proud of
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
As she ^sewed, she told a story
from the Bible she had read \\
About a coat of many colors
Joseph ^wore, and then she said \\
Per^haps this coat will bring you
good ^luck and happiness \\
And I just ^couldn't wait to wear it
and momma ^blessed it with a ^kiss
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
My ^{C}coat of many colors
that my ^{G}momma made for me \\
^{C}Made only from rags
but I ^{G}wore it so ^{D}proudly \\
Al^{G}though we had no money
I was ^{C}rich as I could be \\
In my ^{G}coat of many colors
my ^{D}momma made for ^{G}me \qquad ^{E}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}[class=keychange]
So with ^{A}patches on my britches
and holes in both my shoes \\
In my coat of many colors
I ^{E}hurried off to school \\
Just to ^{A}find the others laughing
and ^{D}making fun of me \\
In my ^{A}coat of many colors
my ^{E}momma made for ^{A}me \\
\end{verse}

\newpage

\begin{verse}[recall-chords=verse-keychange]
And oh, I ^couldn't understand it
for I felt I was rich \\
And I told 'em of the love
my momma ^sewed in every stitch \\
And I ^told 'em all the story
momma ^told me while she sewed \\
And how my ^coat of many colors
was worth ^more than all their ^clothes
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}[recall-chords=false]
But they ^{D}didn't understand it
And I ^{A}tried to make them see \\
That ^{D}one is only poor
Only ^{A}if they choose to ^{E}be \\
Now I ^{A}know we had no money
But I was ^{D}rich as I could be \\
In my ^{A}coat of many colors
My ^{E}momma made for ^{D}me \\
Made just ^{A}for me
\end{chorus}
